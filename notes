check layout for original? chapter 9 in ex book
add more freq to nyquist?
add textfield for each slider, link them
remake so it is sT+1 and w^2/(s^2+2zws+w^2) so that K is gain
add a slider for each variable, write tf as function of those vars, maybe tricky? allow dragging numbers in tf?
have slider for K, delay, and for currently selected pole(s), so 3-4 sliders setting K, delay, w and maybe zeta
or just skip all sliders, and allow marking and dragging on each numerical value in tf (make sure to show the correctly)
allow selecting a freq in nyquist/bode and show that point in both
put some color in the instructions for easier navigation/reading
add notes ala `tooltip!(Point2f(0), "This is a tooltip pointing at x")`

add multiple tfs (one is in focus, the other are just displayed for comparison, each in its own color)

fix precompile or fix packagecompiler?
packagecompiler takes it down to around 45 sec currently, could probably do more with some better precompile statements?

fix tests
